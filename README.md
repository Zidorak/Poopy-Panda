**Welcome**    
Welcome all to the GitHub Repository of our GMTK Game Jam: Poopy Panda. This game was inspired from the theme of the Jam, Built to Scale. So we went out to work on a game that showed this. In the game the panda's nappy will grow in size the more it poops!. Your goal is to escape the nursery without getting caught. Those pesky hoomies want to change your nappy and by god you wont let them!. You must climb through windows, navigate the playground and buildings and fling yourself along with a seesaw to find out how to escape this colorful prison. Be careful though, if your nappy gets too big you might not be able to fit underneath things!
